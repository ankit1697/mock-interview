So to start off with, describe any one particular project that you've worked on recently, primarily involving some form of data science or ML if possible, any particular project and you can go from the problem statement to what you did and how, you know, sort of what the results were or if you had, if you created some business impact.",
            "answer": "Definitely Ankit. So last quarter I worked on a recommendation system for a bookstore. So the problem statement was that the bookstore currently was recommending books by top selling items and it wasn't personalized for the user. So what I and my team did was we created a personalized recommendation system which was based on the recency, frequency and monetary value of the data that we got from. So the data had around 30 book categories for 33k customers and we had the recency, frequency, monetary values and as it is very popular in the marketing segment, we used the RFM to create clusters. So we did two kinds of clustering. The first was the customer value segmentation based on the RFM values which basically gave me four clusters of my customers. Some were the potential loyalists, some were the champions who had very good high RFM values and there were lapsed customers who had low RFM values and that was the first clustering that we did. Within the group style, just explain me, did clustering based on the book categories. Now, as I said, we had somewhere around 30 book categories, but we clubbed them together like history and something subjective was clubbed together. So based on this, we did another clustering, both of which was done using k-means. Once the clusters were ready, we implemented collaborative filtering for both user-based and item-based filtering. To get to see how the personalized recommendation system worked, we implemented an A-B testing framework. So we had a test group and a control group and then we tracked some KPIs like the click through rate, conversion rate and the average session time. So the metrics over the silhouette score, which was 0.44 were kind of okay. So it performed moderately. Yeah, that was the project that I did.",

            "question": "Great. So it sounds like that you had like a two-step approach. First, you were clustering the users and then you were clustering the books and the items, like the purchase. Okay. So you used k-means that I can see. Can you just tell me, so when we do k-means clustering, we prioritize normalizing the features or scaling the features. Do you know why is that important?",
            "answer": "So how k-means works is that randomly centroids are allocated between the data points and then it just calculates the mean of the group, the groups that are present in the centroids and then it gradually updates. Now if there are certain outliers, it is almost very much possible that your centroids or your means will get, they will be disrupted. It will be more inclined towards the outline and we don't want that. So for that purpose, it is necessary that we always normalize or bring it to a uniform scale before we perform k-means.",
            "feedback": "You rightly mentioned that unequal feature scales and outliers can skew centroids, which is a key insight. However, the explanation could benefit from clearer phrasing and a more direct focus on why scaling is important, specifically, because k-means relies on Euclidean distance, which is sensitive to feature magnitudes. You can also give an example here, like having features such as height in meters and weight in grams. Without scaling, the weight in grams would completely overshadow the height in meters in any distance calculation.",

            "id": 4,
            "question": "Got it. Can you tell me some basic differences between k-means and like some other hierarchical clustering methods or like dbscan also for that matter? Can you just tell me some basic differences between these?",
            "answer": "So for k-means, we partition the data into clusters. We define the number of clusters that we want and with dbscan, it is a density based clustering algorithm and in k-means, we define k and dbscan, we define the distance, the minimum distance within which the points will be clustered and also the minimum number of points that we want for it to become a cluster. So the difference between this is that, as I said, that dbscan is more utilized to find the outliers because there is no certain, it will just group the points that are close together so it is good at anticipating the outliers. K-means does not work that way. And we also have hierarchical clustering which is, it basically clusters the entire data group. Either you start with a top down approach or the bottom up approach and in both of the approaches, you either start with the entire data set, one cluster and then divide it until you get to the last data point or you start in the reverse way. You start with one data point and then cluster everything into one single cluster and you can, depending on the length, the depth, you can cut it off anywhere and you will have the desired number of clusters. So these are some different kinds of clustering methods. We also have GMM, which is Gaussian mixture model, which doesn't look at hard probabilities, but it's like a soft divisioning algorithm.",
            "feedback": "You did a good job mentioning multiple clustering algorithms and highlighting some key differences like k-means being centroid-based, DBSCAN being density-based, and hierarchical using agglomerative/divisive approaches. The inclusion of GMM was a nice touch that shows broader awareness. You can further focus on criteria like assumptions, input parameters, ability to handle noise, and cluster shapes",

            "question": "Got it. Yeah. I think that pretty much answers my question. Last question on this front would be, so you said you kind of formulated an A-B testing design. Do you know how basic A-B testing works? How do you split into test and control groups?",
            "answer": "Yeah. So A-B testing is again, we do A-B testing to see if I'm implementing a new thing, how much effective is it. So in A-B testing, there are basically, there's a test group and control group. So first, the control group is what we, we don't introduce that control group with the new feature that we are implementing, but we introduce a new feature to the test group. And then we look at some of the metrics that we want to test. And there's a null hypothesis. There's a null hypothesis that, where the null hypothesis states that the new implementation has no effect on the metric whatsoever. Now your metric could be sales, it could be click through rate, it can be anything. So the null hypothesis states that there was no change in the result. And then you have the alternate hypothesis that it had some kind of impact. So then you run the test and then you compare. And our aim obviously is to reject the null hypothesis because we want to see if it had any impact or not. But given in real life scenarios, only having an impact is not the only factor that we consider. We want to see that implementing the change that you want to do, it converts into something profitable.",
            "feedback": "Good job on mentioning the ultimate goal being profitability or positive business impact is also a great practical touch. However, the explanation would be stronger with more explanation around randomization, statistical significance, and what it means to reject the null hypothesis.",

            "answer": "Yeah, we have different kinds of tests. We have the t-test, the z-test. So the t-test is a t-distribution test and it is used for longer tails. And when the data sample is less than 30, we go with t-test. If it's greater than 30, then we go with z-test. These are just statistical tests which can be around the value of alpha. We can clarify if it passes or not.",

            "question": "Okay, let's go with classification then. Alright, can you tell me what is the difference between precision and recall?",
            "answer": "Okay, so precision and recall goes this way that precision is out of everything that you have predicted, how much is actually true. And recall is out of everything that is true, how much have you actually predicted. So giving you an example, let's say you have to predict if a person churns or not and you predicted that 800 people churned but let's say only 700 actually churned. So you were wrong about the other 100. So that wouldn't be a precision. And let's say there were a total of 850 that churned but you were able to predict only 600 or 650 then that would be recall. So it's the trade-off between the true positives and false positives.",

            "question": "Okay, so let's say you talked about a use case, a churn use case. So what will you think of prioritizing more here, recall or precision? Like if given that churned customers lead to some revenue loss, what would you try to sort of, you know, improve like, or like what would you try to focus on?",
            "answer": "Okay, so since the churned customers lead to revenue loss, I would want to focus on the, I want to predict all the customers that like predict the majority of the customers that have churned. So I would focus on recall in that case. Yeah. So that I don't want to incorrectly approve someone who has the chance of churning and then we do some loss. So yeah, I would prefer recall.",
            "feedback": "Prioritizing recall in a churn scenario often makes sense because you want to identify as many of the actual churners as possible so you can take action. But, the mention of 'incorrectly approved' could be refined, and tying the answer back to false negatives would make your reasoning stronger.",

            "answer": "Yeah. So again, because in this scenario, you said that churning customers have a more impact on the loss side, but if at all both are important, then if I need to look at the precision and the recall, then I would go with the F1 score, which it looks at the harmonic mean between the two.",
            "feedback": "You were right about the F1 score being the harmonic mean of precision and recall. That said, you could explain why harmonic mean (not arithmetic mean) is used (it penalizes extreme imbalances).",

            "answer": "So linear models are very standardized and they divide the, your data into, it's a very hard distinction, but with decision trees, at least it can learn the features on its own. It looks at all the features.",
            "feedback": "It's a good starting point, but several important aspects like linearity assumptions, interpretability, handling of feature interactions, and model flexibility were missing.",

            "id": 12,
            "question": "Okay. Fair enough. And for, so let's say you have XGBoost and you have random forest as tree-based models and logistic as a linear model. There is like a complexity and performance trade-off, which we call the bias variance trade-off. Are you aware about that? Can you just explain me what that is?",
            "answer": "Yes. So bias variance trade-off is again, like you said, it's about the complexity and performance of the model. Now, if the model complexity is too less, then your model would underfit. That means that it would not even, it would not perform well on your training data. And obviously not on your testing as well. Then there's the effect of overfitting where your model learns more than it needs to learn. It learns the noise of the noise in between the data and it will overfit, meaning that it will perform very well on the training data set, but will not perform that well on the test data set on unseen data points. So we don't want that to happen. We want it to be somewhere in the middle ground where it performs well on the unseen data as well. So that is what we call as a bias variance trade-off. And if it underfits, you can always increase the model complexity, but if it overfits, then you have to either decrease the model complexity or apply some regularization techniques or try to do some more cross-validation techniques, apply some cross-validation techniques or some other factors of that sort. And coming back to your question about linear regression and decision trees. So in terms of complexity, the decision trees are obviously complex, but like I said, because decision trees read more into the features. We want to see if it's overfitting or not. If it's not overfitting, then well, you can always go with decision trees, but if it does, then maybe sticking to a simpler module could be the optimal choice.",
            "feedback": "You did a good job capturing the essence of the bias-variance trade-off, particularly how model complexity affects underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance). You also connected it well to practical model choices and mentioned techniques like regularization and cross-validation, which is excellent. YOu can think of providing slightly better definitions of bias and viariance.",

Just a couple more questions, you know, on your experiences, on your most recent experiences, if you could share, let's start with, you know, an experience of you working in a team and let's say, I'm assuming, let's say you had some, if you had some conflicts with some team members or like if you wanted to put forward a point, but like the other team members were not in favor of that, or there was some conflict of ideas between team members. If you've ever come across that situation, how did you sort of work around that or work towards that?",
            "answer": "Yeah, so this happens in every team because that is how it functions in corporate. So yeah, it happened with me as well. It was during the first quarter of my program and it was in my leadership course. So our team, we were working on the, on one, on a Verizon churn case prediction model and like between the group and itself, we had two different opinions. I and one of my friends, we weren't in favor of using a different model, but the others strongly favored with a different model. So the one thing that I had that time that we realized was that the importance of a project manager. So we just, we put forward all of our points and we tried to convince the other team members why we were preparing this, like giving the reasoning of the complexity, the time left for the project and how well the model was performing. And then we just discussed it. And at the end, when everybody was convinced and on board, then that will help the option that I and my friend recommended.",

            "answer": "Yeah. So very recently, like since data science is not my major, and this is the first time I'm dealing with all data science stuff. So I was very much impressed with neural networks, how they function and the large language models that everybody is using and relying so heavily upon. So I was flabbergasted with how it works and the functioning of all of it. And I'm kind of proud that I know how it works at the back end. And I'm not just a front end user of the LLM. So that is something about the technical side that I really liked too much on the non-technical part. Since most of my professors are already working in the industry. So I love the part that I get to learn the experiences. And since many of them work at very big firms like Amazon and Google, I get to know how they deal with their clients, how the storytelling works and the importance of how you should understand the problem statement.
